Circuits are grouped into categories for easier browsing.

Each circuit contains a schematic in 3 formats:
* .sim for use with https://www.falstad.com/circuit/
* .kicad_sch for use with KiCAD, all symbols can be found in the KiCAD/componentlib.kicad_sym library
* .pdf for easy view

A documentation.md file is also included with each circuit for design reference.
